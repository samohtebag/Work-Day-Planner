// set interval to update time in real-time, 1000

// make a function that stores the user text content when they press the save button
// get local storage and set item, get item and set item
// make a variable for what you are taking from the text box and the time that you have
// call the colors (classList) for things that have passed, current items, and future items
// when you call a class/id made on the CSS, use jQuery method .addClass();

// save button -> use siblings and parents to get the var for the text/time
// moment.js -> 
// when you get current time, specify in hours to make the function easier (military time is a hint)
