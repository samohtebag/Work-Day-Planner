## Description

In this web application, we've built a daily planner.

In the header, we have the short introduction and a clock displaying the live date and time

Within each time block, you can write each part of your day, hour by hour, and save it to local storage within the browser

The colors of the time slots will vary. Grey represents past tasks, Red represents current tasks, and Green represents future tasks
